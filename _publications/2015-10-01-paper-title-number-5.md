This paper develops a reduced-order 1+3D numerical model for evaluating the performance of solar borehole thermal energy storage systems by coupling a one-dimensional fluid flow and convective heat-transfer model in the heat exchanger with a three-dimensional conductive heat-transfer model in the surrounding strata. The model achieves a drastic reduction in computational cost compared to full-order solvers and is validated against experimental data and commercial finite-volume simulations.
