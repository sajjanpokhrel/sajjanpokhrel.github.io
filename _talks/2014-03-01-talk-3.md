I this conference, I presented the results of field-scale experimental and numerical analyses of a 500 m deep coaxial borehole heat exchanger system for a geothermal power generation application.It is the second field-test experiment on coaxial borehole heat exchanger system for power generation application after 1991 in Hawaii.
