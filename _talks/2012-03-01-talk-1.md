This talk was presented virtually on 9th International Renewable and Sustainable Energy Conference - 2021. In this presentation, a municipal sewage heat recovery system is proposed to supply the thermal demand of the multifamily residential building with 826 apartment units throughout the year. A Solar-PV system that feeds energy to the heat pumps and water pumps of the sewage heat recovery system is proposed to make it 100 % green. Technical and economic aspects of the project are discussed in the analysis.
