Welcome to my webpage!

<div class="small-intro">

<p>
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the Thermal Energy Storage group. I am passionate about energy systems, ranging from coal to fusion and everything in between. My primary research focus is geothermal energy and its utilization in heating, cooling, and power generation applications (Enhanced Geothermal Systems).
</p>

<p>
At my current role, I collaborate closely with <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/xiaobing-liu" target="_blank">Xiaobing Liu</a> to conduct research on geothermal heat pumps, development of shallow unconventional heat exchangers, and extraction of geothermal energy from abandoned underground mines. I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://profiles.lbl.gov/18855-christine-doughty" target="_blank">Christine Doughty</a> on subsurface modeling for geothermal applications using TOUGH3. I also work with <a href="https://ceat.okstate.edu/mae/faculty-staff/faculty-bios/jeffrey-spitler.html" target="_blank"> Prof. Jeff Spittler</a> on numerical modeling of geothermal heat exchangers, along with other scientists across national laboratories, universities, and industry on geothermal research. I spent five years during my PhD with my advisor, <a href="https://mining.ubc.ca/ali-g-madiseh" target="_blank">Prof. Ali Madiseh,</a> at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a> in Vancouver before earning a master’s degree in Energy Engineering from <a href="https://www.wright.edu/" target="_blank">Wright State University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://people.wright.edu/james.menart" target="_blank">Prof. James Menart</a>. Prior to that, I completed a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Tribhuvan University, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal, where I worked with the late Prof. Bhakta Bahadur Ale on my final year capstone project.
