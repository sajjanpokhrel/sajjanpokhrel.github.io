Welcome to my webpage!

I am Sajjan Pokhrel, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). I am also serving as Vice President of the Oak Ridge Postdoctoral Association Executive Committee (ORPEX-25). I am passionate about energy systems, all the way from coal to fusion and everything in between. However, I work more on geothermal energy and its utilization in different applications for heating, cooling, and power generation.
